# MockPersonaClassAdventure

An introduction to your project:

-My project is a simulation of all Persona 3 player's favorite part of the game, the slice of life. Persona is a single player RPG and they have a unique stat section. You gain stats by talking and making friends, scoring correctly on tests, and plundering the dungeon. This project looks to simulate the main character's school life, always having to choose between keeping yourself awake throghout class to gain "academics," stat or letting yourself fall asleep to gain "courage," stat. 

A discussion of the technical framework you used or developed

-I used Twine, a very powerful tool in developing adventure chatbox games as it essentially makes the html file for you. I also used Github pages to actually allow access to the game. 

Information on installing and/or running the project

-To run the game you simply need to have access to the repository then put in the following link into the search bar:
 https://jrod1621.github.io/MockPersonaClassAdventure/MockPersonaClassAdventure.html

A description of how each node is stored

-The passages from the Twine are ALL stored in the html file, tags were used in unison with hooks which were stored on the passages which then were relevant in reference of CSS. Through story states such as $day, and $answer, both representing different scenes as the interactions that follow are based upon those states. EVERY passage in my Twine project is a node/state in the sense that every state can be a node but not every node is a state. Hooks are also nodes, making up a big part of Harlowe Twine, allowing you to "wrap," html to create macros, which are STORED functions that complete operations, set variables, etc.

A description of your mechanism for switching between nodes

-Since Twine is so abundant in nodes, I learned more about the terms of node switching, some are wiki links, and macro links. Wiki links are the more "basic," links found in my game that allow for seamless switching between basic interactions such as sleeping or checking your stats. Macro links are the ones that usually need to be discovered such as the ending, or play again. Finally, if statements were used to switch between nodes often as it's required to determine if the player wins the game or not. It constantly checks for if the player reached the required amount of stat  for a certain ending.

Reflection on what you have learned

-I've learned immensely more about more advanced practices in html, not just the stock standard website development. I banged my head for a while trying to understand Harlow's Twine at first as the new interactions with html caught me off guard, and lead to me brute forcing SOME aspects. I'd like to eventually perfect these sorts of functions in coding as a whole as it's what I believe is necessary for me to go from just some college cs student to an actual engineer.

Please also explain any parts of the project you are particularly proud of

-I had REALLY big hopes for a moving background because I thought it would be simple with the footage I could already capture from my pc from Persona 3 Reload... boy was I wrong. I spent HOURS trying to do it until I realized it was against what you said, you wanted a simple light amount of coding project, so I stuck to something more basic. I love the world of Persona so I wanted to share at least some sort of visual and I'm glad and proud that I got to share one of the more livley parts of the game.

Also consider things you would have like to get to

-Sounds, Persona 3 is known for it's sublime music, and I feel like I should have done it justice by at least including a sound track while the game ran. My favorite song from the game is Color Your Night, and I would have most likley used that song to bring it all together.
